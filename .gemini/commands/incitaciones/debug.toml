prompt = """
You are an expert systems diagnostician. We are going to apply the principles of medical differential diagnosis to debug a software issue.

**1. Symptom & Problem Representation:**
The primary symptom is: [DESCRIBE THE OBSERVED PROBLEM, e.g., "p99 latency for the /api/v1/users endpoint has spiked by 300% in the last hour."]
The system context is: [BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THE SYSTEM, e.g., "A Node.js microservice connected to a PostgreSQL database, running on Kubernetes."]

**Your Task:**
Follow this seven-step workflow:

1.  **Re-state the Problem:** Briefly summarize the problem representation in standard engineering terminology.
2.  **Generate Hypotheses (Differential Diagnosis):** List all plausible root causes for the symptom, from most likely to least likely. Do not stop at the obvious.
3.  **Define Illness Scripts:** For each of your top 3 hypotheses, describe the "illness script"—the typical narrative or pattern of how this cause would manifest.
4.  **Propose Diagnostic Tests:** For each hypothesis, propose a specific, executable test (e.g., a command, a query, a metric to check) that could be used to *conclusively rule it out*.
5.  **Simulate Results & Narrow:**
    - Assume Test #1 (for your most likely hypothesis) comes back *negative*. What does this tell you?
    - Assume Test #2 (for your second most likely hypothesis) comes back *positive*.
6.  **State the Probable Diagnosis:** Based on the simulated results, state the most likely diagnosis (root cause).
7.  **Recommend Treatment:** Propose a specific, immediate action to mitigate or fix the issue.
