# Install: lefthook install
# Bypass (WIP only): git push --no-verify
#
# ⚠️  --no-verify requires:
#   - Commit message MUST contain "WIP" or "wip"
#   - Tests MUST be fixed before merging

pre-commit:
  parallel: true
  commands:
    format-check:
      glob: "*.rs"
      run: cargo fmt -- --check
    lint:
      glob: "*.rs"
      run: cargo clippy -- -D warnings

  commands:
    test:
      run: just pre-push
      fail_text: |
        ❌ Tests failed. Push blocked.
        
        To bypass (WIP only): git push --no-verify
        
        ⚠️  --no-verify requires justification:
        - Commit message MUST contain "WIP" or "wip"
        - You MUST fix tests before merging
