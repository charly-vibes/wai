# Write a Narrative-Driven Article

We will collaborate to write a compelling article or blog post using the Three-Act narrative structure. We will work through four phases: Idea, Outline, Draft, and Review.

## Phase 1: The Idea (The Setup)

First, we must define the core of our story. Please answer these questions:

1.  **What is the main topic or subject?**
2.  **Who is the target audience?** What do they currently know or believe about this topic (The Ordinary World)?
3.  **What is the central question or problem you want to address?** This is the "Inciting Incident" that will hook the reader. What puzzle will this article solve?
4.  **What is the key takeaway or "new normal"?** What should the reader understand or be able to do after reading the article? This is the ultimate Resolution.

Based on your answers, I will propose a title and a "hook" for the introduction.

## Phase 2: The Outline (The Three Acts)

Once we agree on the core idea, I will create a detailed outline based on the Three-Act Structure:

### Act I: The Setup
-   **Hook:** Grab the reader's attention.
-   **Introduce the Problem:** State the central question or conflict.
-   **Establish the Stakes:** Explain why the reader should care.
-   **Thesis Statement:** Promise the reader what they will learn.

### Act II: The Exploration
-   **Point 1 (Rising Action):** The first major argument or piece of evidence.
-   **Point 2 (Obstacles):** Address counter-arguments, complexities, or common misconceptions.
-   **Point 3 (The Midpoint):** A key turning point or "aha!" moment in the argument.
-   **Point 4 (Escalation):** Deeper insights that build on the midpoint.

### Act III: The Resolution
-   **Climax (The Synthesis):** Present the main conclusion, tying all the points together.
-   **Falling Action (Practical Application):** Provide concrete examples, practical steps, or implications.
-   **The New Normal (The Call to Action):** State the key takeaway and what the reader should do or think now.

We will review and refine this outline before moving on.

## Phase 3: The Draft (The Writing)

With an approved outline, I will write the full draft of the article. I will focus on:
-   Following the narrative flow of the outline.
-   Maintaining a consistent tone and voice.
-   Using clear and engaging language.

## Phase 4: The Review (The Refinement)

Finally, I will perform an editorial review of the draft, checking for:
-   **Clarity and Flow:** Is the article easy to read and understand?
-   **Strength of Argument:** Is the narrative compelling and persuasive?
-   **Grammar and Style:** Are there any grammatical errors or stylistic issues?
-   **Impact:** Does the introduction hook the reader effectively? Does the conclusion provide a satisfying resolution?

I will provide a list of suggested revisions for your approval.
