# Optionality Review

Review this [CODE/ARCHITECTURE/PLAN/DECISION] through the lens of strategic optionality.

## Phase 1: Decision Classification

Classify key decisions using Bezos's framework:

**Type 1 (One-Way Doors):** Consequential and irreversible - require careful consideration
**Type 2 (Two-Way Doors):** Changeable and reversible - should be made quickly with ~70% information

**Early Exit:** If NO Type 1 decisions identified, recommend "Proceed quickly" and skip to final report.

## Phase 2: Alternative Paths

For Type 1 decisions, evaluate 2-4 alternatives with what each locks in and enables.

## Phase 3: Exit Costs & Escape Hatches

Map reversal cost, time, and concrete escape hatches for each Type 1 decision.

**Reversibility Score:** [1-10]

## Phase 4: Failure Modes & Fallbacks

| Failure Scenario | Probability | Impact | Fallback Plan |
|------------------|-------------|--------|---------------|

**Resilience Score:** [1-10]

## Phase 5: Future Value Assessment

Options CREATED vs Options DESTROYED (with justification)
Growth potential: Can scale to 10x? Can add features without rewrite?

**Future Value Score:** [1-10]

## Phase 6: Decision Points & Triggers

Define milestones and reassessment triggers.

## Final Report

**Overall Optionality:** [X/10]
**Verdict:** [FLEXIBLE | BALANCED | LOCKED_IN | CONCERNING]
**The Bottom Line:** Is the level of lock-in appropriate for our uncertainty level?
