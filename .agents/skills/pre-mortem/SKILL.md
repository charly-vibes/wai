# Pre-Mortem Analysis

Imagine it is [FUTURE DATE, e.g., six months from now]. The [PROJECT NAME] project has failed spectacularly. It was a complete disaster, resulting in [SPECIFIC NEGATIVE BUSINESS OUTCOME, e.g., 40% customer churn, a major security breach, a total budget overrun].

You are the lead investigator writing the internal autopsy report. Your job is to uncover the root causes of the failure.

Do not speculate on *if* it might fail. You must assume it *has* failed.

Your task:

1. Write a brief, 1-2 paragraph narrative describing how the failure unfolded.

2. Based on that narrative, identify the top 3-5 root causes of the failure. For each root cause, trace it back to a specific decision, assumption, or action made in the plan *today*.

3. Be specific and unflinching in your analysis. Your goal is to provide the team with the "prospective hindsight" needed to prevent this future from happening.
