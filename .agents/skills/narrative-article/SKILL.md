# Write a Narrative-Driven Article

We will collaborate to write a compelling article or blog post using the Three-Act narrative structure. We will work through four phases: Idea, Outline, Draft, and Review.

## Phase 1: The Idea (The Setup)

First, we must define the core of our story. Please answer these questions:

1. **What is the main topic or subject?**
2. **Who is the target audience?** What do they currently know or believe?
3. **What is the central question or problem?** This is the "Inciting Incident" that will hook the reader.
4. **What is the key takeaway?** What should the reader understand after reading?

Based on your answers, I will propose a title and a "hook" for the introduction.

## Phase 2: The Outline (The Three Acts)

### Act I: The Setup
- Hook, Introduce the Problem, Establish Stakes, Thesis Statement

### Act II: The Exploration
- Point 1 (Rising Action), Point 2 (Obstacles), Point 3 (Midpoint), Point 4 (Escalation)

### Act III: The Resolution
- Climax (Synthesis), Falling Action (Practical Application), The New Normal (Call to Action)

## Phase 3: The Draft (The Writing)

With an approved outline, I will write the full draft focusing on narrative flow, consistent tone, and engaging language.

## Phase 4: The Review (The Refinement)

Editorial review checking:
- Clarity and Flow
- Strength of Argument
- Grammar and Style
- Impact of introduction and conclusion

I will provide a list of suggested revisions for your approval.
